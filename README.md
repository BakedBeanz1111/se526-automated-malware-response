# se526-automated-malware-response
Research Project for SE526 for developing an automated response for handling static and dynamic analysis for malware samples.


# Validation and Verification Test Plan
This section of the document will cover the V&V plan to confirm the automation was built to do what it was intended to do.

We will be following the procedure outlined in Lab 1 for executing static and dynamic analysis for each lab sample.

### Task Road Map in terms of priority ###
 Automate static and dynamic analysis on per sample basis
 Pull data of samples off VM
 Automate VM snapshot control to sanitize execution environmnet for each sample
 Automate UI interactions of GUI tools inside the VM

### Proposed Tool Dependencies for Development ###
1) Powershell/CMD(Powershell or Batch)
2) Python 3.7
3) Robot Test Automation Framework
4) WinAppDriver
5) Appium

### Task List ###
1) Write Static Analysis procedure
2) Write Dynamic Analysis procedure
3) Write Data Retrieval procedure
4) Write Snapshot automation procedure
5) Automate UI Interactions on GUI tools
